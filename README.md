# TechDegreeProject-3

Project #3 introduces the form as a common UI device, and for this project, I have included all options to collect the user's data with intuitive form controls to increase UX. This includes option boxes, conditional other input boxes and mutually exclusive options and checkboxes. This project also includes the concept of form validation, and I used regular expressions to build my input test arguments. Some validation occurs upon keyup and all others display upon submit.

### What does it do?

The form displayed in this project allows the user to register for a fictional software development conference. It captures the user's data including: name, email, job title, t-shirt size and design, desired courses and payment. This form also makes the user unable to select multiple options when the options are mutually exclusive. It also provides feedback in the form of form validation if the user does not enter valid information into the form.
